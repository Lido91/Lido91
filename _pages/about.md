I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma, advised by [Yi Wu](https://ywu960702.github.io/). My research explores how 3D perception systems reason about complex environments using point clouds, natural-language grounding, and foundation models.

Research Interests
======
- Computer vision and 3D world understanding
- Point cloud processing and self-supervised learning
- Multi-modal learning and language-guided perception
- Foundation models for geometry-rich data

Recent Highlights
======
- **Segment any 3D-Part from a sentence** - introduced open-vocabulary part segmentation in 3D scenes; AAAI 2026 (under review).
- **Learnable deformation for point cloud augmentation** - devised self-supervised deformations and saliency-guided mixup, reaching 93.7% accuracy on ModelNet40.
- **Qualcomm-UvA Lab research internships** - built scalable 3D part datasets and search-localize pipelines for fine-grained understanding.

Education
======
- PhD in Computer Science, University of Oklahoma, Norman, United States (2025-present)
- MSc in Computer Science, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands (2022-2024)
- BEng in Software Engineering (Big Data), Guizhou University, China (2018-2022)
